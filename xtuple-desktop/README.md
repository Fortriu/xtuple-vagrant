See the [xtuple-vagrant wiki](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-vagrant/wiki/Home) to get started. Then follow the instructions to create a
[Desktop *and* Mobile](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-vagrant/wiki/Creating-a-Vagrant-Virtual-Environment-For-Qt-AND-Mobile-Development) development environment.

If you want to work on the desktop application only, you can use an [xTuple Server VM](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-server/wiki/Set-up-a-Vagrant-VM-for-the-xTuple-Server) or [mobile-only development environment](Creating-a-Vagrant-Virtual-Environment-For-Mobile-Development) to run the database server.
